- The register page will ask for:

  - Password
- Submit this information in order to create an account. "Sign up" successful will appear and then you may log in and out of the app. 

### Databases
  The main database used within this app is Firebase. In this case, Firebase is being utilized in order to store user credentials. This allows the user to enter and exit the application along with restore credentials. 
  
# Login
